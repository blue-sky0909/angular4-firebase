# Oevent2

I have used Angular4, Firebase, Angular-CLI,Karma and Typescript.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
